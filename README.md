✈️ Airline Price Analysis – Python Project
📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing airline ticket data to understand how various factors influence flight prices. Using Python, the notebook explores relationships between airlines, cities, timing, and travel class, aiming to uncover pricing trends and customer insights for better decision-making.

🎯 Business Objectives

The primary goal is to analyze flight pricing patterns and answer key business questions related to airlines, cities and timing.

🧾 Business Questions

Q1. What are the airlines in the dataset, accompanied by their frequencies?
Q2. Show bar graphs representing the Departure Time & Arrival Time.
Q3. Show bar graphs representing the Source City & Destination City.
Q4. Does price vary with airlines?
Q5. Does ticket price change based on the departure time and arrival time?
Q6. How does the price change with changes in Source and Destination?
Q7. How is the price affected when tickets are bought 1 or 2 days before departure?
Q8. How does the ticket price vary between Economy and Business class?
Q9. What is the average price of a Vistara flight from Delhi to Hyderabad (Business Class)?


📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations and insights were generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore:

Airline frequency distribution.

Flight timing trends (departure & arrival).

Source and destination city demand.

Pricing variation by airline, timing, route, and class.

Last-minute booking impact on prices.

💡 Insights Summary

Prices vary significantly across airlines, with premium carriers charging more.

Flights departing during peak hours or closer to departure date cost higher.

Business class tickets are consistently higher, especially on busy routes.

Vistara’s Delhi → Hyderabad (Business) route has a higher average price compared to competitors.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
